# About this List

Selection criteria are:

- all hand-reviewed
- quality over quantity
- prefer printable
- reasonable size (<= 4 pages)
- accurate
- good selection of facts
- topic is of reasonably broad appeal

Where I list seveal cheatsheets for the same topic, the ones at the top are those I consider the best. Particularly great cheat-sheets are marked with one (⭐) or even two (⭐⭐) stars.

The list is still in very early development; more coming soon. [to all those reading this several years after the last commit: greetings from the past, hope the planet isn't burning yet!]
